        <h2>The Awesome Guy!</h2>

        <p> Originally I'm from Georgia but, Uncle Sam had other ideas and landed me in Texas. I'm 31 years old but I still get asked 
            for ID going in too buy a Corona. After high-school I went to college at Coastal Carolina to play a bit of football, there
            I had a son. From there I became a firefighter but, I got pretty bored and wanted more of a challenge so I made a huge decision
            to join the US Army. I left the military in the midst of covid and decided to buy my own semi-truck and become an owner operator.
            The business was good but, with a wife and a kid I had to hire someone and come home. Now I'm a maintenance tech 2 at Dell Seton
            hospital in Austin, Texas. I spend my time with my family, going on hikes, playing Call of Duty, being hot or cold at my son's 
            soccer games, or my favorite buying sneakers. </p>
